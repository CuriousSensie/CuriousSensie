<p align="center">
 Currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science, I’m passionate about building scalable, user-friendly, and AI-powered web applications.  
 I work mostly as a freelance engineer, crafting products that are not only functional but also delightful to use.  
 My goal is to bring ideas to life — whether it's a SaaS platform, custom sites, in-house app solutions, or intelligent business solution.
